# workout-tracker

A simple web app for tracking your workouts. You can pick up where you left off or log a new workout.
When visiting the dashboard, you are presented with four charts to track various statistics, these are:

* (i) a graph that tracks how much time (minutes) you spent working out per day;
* (ii) a graph that tracks how much weight (lbs) you lifted per day.
* (iii) a pie chart that shows the exercises you have completed by time (i.e. so you can see which exercise you have spent the most/least time doing).
* (iv) a pie chart that shows the exercises completed by weight (i.e. so you can see which the exercise you have lifted the most/least doing).
